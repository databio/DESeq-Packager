# DESeq-Packager
From Aaron Gu

DESeq-Packager takes in a pepr project and puts all of the data from the file into a countTable data structure necessary for DESeq.

I have included the DESeq functions for graphing the expression change (`plotDispEsts` and `plotMA`) as well as the table of genes with significant differential expression (`resSig`) in this code.
