# DESeq-Packager
From Aaron Gu

DESeq-Packager takes in a pepr project (https://pepkit.github.io/docs/pepr/) and puts all of the data from the files into a countTable data structure, which is necessary for DESeq.

I have included the DESeq functions for graphing the expression change (`plotDispEsts` and `plotMA`) as well as the table of genes with significant differential expression (`resSig`) in this code.
